# Core Bluetooth

## What to open

- Use `corebluetooth/AboutCoreBluetooth.md` and `corebluetooth/CoreBluetoothOverview.md` for concepts and role orientation.
- Use `corebluetooth/PerformingCommonCentralRoleTasks.md` for step-by-step central workflows.
- Use `corebluetooth/PerformingCommonPeripheralRoleTasks.md` for step-by-step peripheral workflows.
- Use `corebluetooth/BestPracticesforInteractingwithaRemotePeripheralDevice.md` and `corebluetooth/BestPracticesforSettingUpYourLocalDeviceasaPeripheral.md` for pitfalls and best practices.
- Use `corebluetooth/CoreBluetoothBackgroundProcessingforiOSApps.md` for background modes and lifecycle constraints.
- Use `corebluetooth/BluetoothStateRestorationAppReaunchRules.md` for state restoration app relaunch rules.
- Use `corebluetooth/corebluetooth.md` for API quick maps and symbol lookup.

## Workflow

- Identify whether the app acts as a central, a peripheral, or both.
- Wait for the manager state to be `poweredOn` before issuing BLE operations.
- Follow the role checklist to keep discovery and connection order correct.
- Open the role task guide and best practices first; use the API reference for exact signatures.

## Central checklist

1. Create a `CBCentralManager` with a delegate and queue.
2. Handle `centralManagerDidUpdateState(_:)` and gate scanning on `.poweredOn`.
3. Scan with `scanForPeripherals(withServices:options:)` and stop when the target is found.
4. Connect, set the `CBPeripheral` delegate, and discover services and characteristics.
5. Read, write, or subscribe to characteristic notifications as needed.

## Peripheral checklist

1. Create a `CBPeripheralManager` with a delegate and queue.
2. Wait for the state to become `.poweredOn`.
3. Define services and characteristics, then add them to the manager.
4. Start advertising with service UUIDs and optional local name.
5. Respond to read and write requests; publish updates to subscribed centrals.

## Reminders

- Retain discovered `CBPeripheral` instances to keep them alive.
- Use notifications for streaming data; use write-without-response only when `canSendWriteWithoutResponse` is true.
- Use L2CAP only for use cases that do not fit GATT characteristics.
